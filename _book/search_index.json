You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Définition du scoring 2.2 Objectif du scoring 2.3 Principe du scoring 2.4 Etape du scoring", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Définition du scoring 2.2 Objectif du scoring 2.3 Principe du scoring 2.4 Etape du scoring "],["développement-du-scoring.html", "Chapter 3 Développement du scoring 3.1 Données 3.2 Méthodes", " Chapter 3 Développement du scoring 3.1 Données 3.1.1 Exploration des données library(lubridate) # les dates ## ## Attaching package: &#39;lubridate&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## date, intersect, setdiff, union variable à expliquer variables explicatives 3.1.2 Identification de la population éligible 3.1.3 Nettoyage des données 3.1.4 Equilibrage des données 3.1.5 Segmentation de la base d’étude : Clustering 3.1.6 Construction des variables explicatives 3.1.7 Optimisation des variables explicatives 3.1.8 Echantillonnage de la base d’étude 3.2 Méthodes 3.2.1 Construction des modèles 3.2.2 Evaluation des modèles 3.2.3 Interpretation des modèles "],["exploitation-du-score.html", "Chapter 4 Exploitation du score 4.1 Application du score 4.2 Bilan du score 4.3 Industrialisation du score 4.4 Suivi du score", " Chapter 4 Exploitation du score You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter).

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2023) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
